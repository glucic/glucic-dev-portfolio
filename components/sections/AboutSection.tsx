                    I'm an experienced Software Developer with over 7 years of hands-on experience in backend development, primarily using PHP and Laravel. I have a strong foundation in building and maintaining scalable systems within structured, agile teams.
                    <br /><br />
                    I'm highly proficient with technologies like PHP, Laravel, Symfony, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Kubernetes, and have additional experience working with JavaScript, Node.js, Java, Spring Boot, and AngularJS.
                    <br /><br />
                    Beyond technical skills, I bring a strong sense of ownership, a deep understanding of clean and maintainable code, and the ability to contribute to long-term software architecture. Iâ€™ve collaborated across teams, participated in migrating legacy monoliths into modern systems, and worked closely with UX teams to ensure user-centered solutions.
                    <br /><br />
                    Fluent in English, German, and Croatian, I thrive in multicultural environments and agile workflows. My ambition is to grow into a Lead Software Architect role, where I can take a broader responsibility for the design and evolution of complex systems.
